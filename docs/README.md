# Documentation Folder

This folder is reserved for future Orkait developer documentation.

## Current Status

The current documentation is orkait/GraphQL technical content and is not relevant to Orkait's current services. The docs are kept here for reference but are not linked in navigation.

## Future Use

When Orkait develops a developer API or needs technical documentation:

1. Replace the existing docs with Orkait-specific documentation
2. Update `sidebars.ts` with your documentation structure
3. The docs are already configured in `docusaurus.config.ts` and will be accessible at `/docs`

## Documentation Structure

The docs plugin is already configured. You can organize your documentation by:
- Creating markdown files in this folder
- Organizing them into subfolders as needed
- Updating `sidebars.ts` to define the navigation structure
